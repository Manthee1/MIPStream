# DLX Web-Based Simulator

This project is a web-based simulator for the DLX architecture. It allows users to simulate and execute DLX assembly code in a browser environment.

## Features

- Interactive DLX simulator
- Support for executing DLX assembly code
- Step-by-step execution mode
- Register and memory visualization
- Input/output handling

## Getting Started

To get started with the DLX web-based simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/manthee1/dlx-simulator.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Start the simulator: `yarn start`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Write or import DLX assembly code into the simulator.
2. Set the initial values of registers and memory if needed.
3. Choose the execution mode (step-by-step or continuous).
4. Execute the code and observe the register and memory changes.
5. Analyze the output and debug if necessary.
