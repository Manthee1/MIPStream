Instruction pipelining is an intrestingly simple concept... But to truly understanding this idea of parallelism can be challenging. It feels like reading music without ever hearing a song. The flow, the stalls, the hazardsâ€”they were words without a melody. And many tools that try to help with visualizing these notes are outdated in today's day and age.
This thesis was born out of a desire to transform that silence into a beautiful symphony, crafting an instrument that would allow learners to not just see, but experience the song of instruction pipelining.

In contrast to how a non pipelined processor works, a pipelined processor executes multiple instructions simultaneously. One at each stage of the pipeline. This allows for a higher throughput of instructions, but also introduces a new set of challenges.

The problem is that there is no modern, user-friendly tool that allows for the visualization of instruction pipelining in a way that is easy to understand. Most tools are either outdated, or too complex to use, which makes it difficult for students to learn about this interesting topic.

To bridge the gap. This thesis aims to analyze existing solutions, identify their limitations, and propose a comprehensive solution in the form of a web-based instruction pipeline simulator
The paper is organized as follows: Chapter 2 provides an analysis of existing solutions, Chapter 3 presents the proposed solution, Chapter 4 describes the implementation of the solution, Chapter 5 discusses the verification of the solution, and Chapter 6 concludes the paper with a summary and future work.
